## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted to explore building a fully custom e-commerce product configurator from scratch — something that not only works but delivers a premium, minimal, and delightful experience for customers. ChrisCase was the perfect opportunity to push my skills in **Next.js**, **Stripe payments**, **image uploads**, and **UI/UX design** while creating my own brand from the ground up.

## 🛠 Problems I Solved

- **Upload feature fix** – The original tutorial’s file upload system was broken due to outdated dependencies. I rewrote it to work with the latest versions.
- **Stripe payment updates** – Migrated the payment flow to work with modern Stripe APIs.
- **Progress persistence** – Added back buttons for Step 2 and Step 3 so that if users go back, their progress is saved in `localStorage`.
- **UI improvements** – Designed a complete, unique brand and visual identity, improving the original layout and design for a more polished experience.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Deep dive into the **Next.js 15 App Router** and advanced routing patterns.
- Handling **real-time image uploads and previews** with drag-and-drop.
- Creating **state persistence** across multiple steps with localStorage.
- Integrating **Stripe Checkout** with the latest API changes.
- Crafting a consistent **brand identity** and UI system from scratch.

## ✅ TODO

- [ ] Implement email sending after a successful payment confirmation.
- [ ] Add more device types and case variations.
